Current bugs:

Current shortcomings:

 * provide STDIN logging so we can function as minilog daemon on
   startup and write directly to logfiles without the need for
   sockets to be active
 * Implement HUP signal to reread config && restart daemon
 * pipe functionality is not implemented
 * the parser is too forgiving (error checking)
 * socket nodelay option?
 * test with syslog-ng for rule parsing
 * -- MARK -- timestamps are missing (requires timer)

Wishlist items:

 * postrotate hooks to signal apache/squid etc
 * set owner/perms of logfiles
 * remove syslog_ng crap and unify pattern matching
